# 🎛 Jauto-tools

Studio workflow automation scripts for engineers, assistants, and techs.  
Zero setup. No terminal needed. Just unzip, click, and go.

## 📦 What's Inside

Each folder includes:
- `script.py` — automation logic (preconfigured)
- `run.command` — double-click launcher for non-technical users
- `python3.10/` — bundled Python runtime + dependencies
- `README.txt` — usage notes specific to the tool

These tools are plug-and-play for macOS users.  
No pip installs, no Terminal commands, no BS.

## ✅ How To Use (Universal Steps)

1. **Unzip** the folder
2. **Right-click → Open** on `run.command`
3. Grant permissions if prompted (see below)
4. Follow on-screen prompts (arrow-key selection, etc.)

> The script runs inside a bundled Python 3.10 environment.  
> No system-level install needed.

## ⚠️ macOS Permission Steps

On first run, macOS will block the script:
- Right-click `run.command` → click **Open**
- If blocked again, go to:
  **System Settings → Privacy & Security → Allow Anyway**
- Once approved, it’ll work every time
